# FunWithButtons
This code is not intended to use in the real web.
It's for the webviewer of FileMaker(Mac)/FileaMaker Go.
I made this for fun, testing click-effects of buttons.

SimplePanel.fmp12 : You can not only see and try click/touch effects, but also create new one using FileMaker.
Other files : I use these code in SimplePanel.fmp12
